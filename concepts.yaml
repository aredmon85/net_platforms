latency:
	- Propagation delay: 
		- 3.34 microseconds per kilometer in a vacuum, ~5 microseconds per kilometer in fiber accounting for refraction
	- Serialization delay:
		- Varying latency based on the speed of the interface and size of the datagram.  1500B on a 10G link takes 1.2 microseconds to serialize.
